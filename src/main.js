/**
 * Angry-Birds-7
 * The "Polish" Update
 *
 * Original Lua by: Colton Ogden (cogden@cs50.harvard.edu)
 * Adapted to JS by: Vikram Singh (vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca)
 *
 * Released by Rovio in 2009, Angry Birds took the mobile gaming scene by storm back
 * when it was still arguably in its infancy. Using the simple gameplay mechanic of
 * slingshotting birds into fortresses of various materials housing targeted pigs,
 * Angry Birds succeeded with its optimized formula for on-the-go gameplay. It's an
 * excellent showcase of the ubiquitous Box2D physics library, the most widely used
 * physics library of its kind, which is also open source. This "clone" of Angry Birds
 * doesn't contain nearly the plethora of features as the original series of games
 * it's based on but does use Matter.js to showcase the fundamental setup of what the
 * game looks like and how to use a subset of the physics library's features.
