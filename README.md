# Angry Birds - A 2D Physics-Based Game üê¶

## Overview

This is a 2D physics-based game inspired by the popular mobile game, Angry Birds. The game use the Matter.js physics engine to simulate realistic bird flight and object interactions.

## Features

### Bird Mechanics

    Yellow Bird: Gains a burst of speed when the spacebar is pressed.
    White Bird: Lays an egg that acts as a projectile.

### Level Design

    Destructible Blocks: Wooden and glass blocks with varying levels of durability.
    Dynamic Environments: Levels with unique layouts and challenges.

### Visual Effects

    Explosion Animations: Blocks explode upon destruction.
    Particle Effects: Debris and smoke particles add visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 Canvas: For rendering the game graphics.
JavaScript: For game logic, physics simulations, and user input handling.
Matter.js: For physics engine to simulate realistic object interactions.

## How to Play

Launch a Bird: Click and drag the bird to aim, then release to launch.
Use Special Abilities: Press the spacebar to activate the special ability of the selected bird.
Destroy the Pigs: Use the birds to destroy the pigs and clear the level.
